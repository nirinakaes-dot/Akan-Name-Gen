## Behavior-Driven Development

Given a seeker of names enters the day they were born
And chooses the gender that speaks their truth
When they press the button to reveal their fate
Then an Akan name rises, calling them by tradition

Given a wanderer submits details flawed or incomplete
When they ask the generator to speak
Then a gentle warning appears, guiding them to try again
