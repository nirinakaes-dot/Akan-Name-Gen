## AKAN NAME GENERATOR

## Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that generates an Akan name based on a user’s birth date and gender. Akan names originate from the Akan people of Ghana, where children are traditionally named according to the day of the week they were born. This project helps users learn their Akan name in a fun and interactive way.

## Behavior-Driven Development

Given a seeker of names enters the day they were born
And chooses the gender that speaks their truth
When they press the button to reveal their fate
Then an Akan name rises, calling them by tradition

Given a wanderer submits details flawed or incomplete
When they ask the generator to speak
Then a gentle warning appears, guiding them to try again
